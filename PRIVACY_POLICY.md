# TimeTwister Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** June 24, 2025

## Overview
TimeTwister is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your data should stay yours.

## Data We Handle

### What We Store Locally
- **Timezone preferences**: For websites you configure (stored in Chrome's sync storage)
- **Time format preference**: Your choice between 12-hour and 24-hour display
- **Favorite timezones**: Timezones you star for quick access

### What We Do NOT Do
- ❌ **No external servers**: All data stays in your browser
- ❌ **No tracking**: We don't track your browsing habits
- ❌ **No analytics**: No usage statistics collected
- ❌ **No third-party sharing**: Your data never leaves your control
- ❌ **No personal information**: We don't collect names, emails, or identifiers

## How We Use Permissions

### Storage Permission
- **Purpose**: Save your timezone preferences
- **Scope**: Only timezone settings you explicitly configure
- **Location**: Chrome's built-in sync storage (stays within Chrome ecosystem)

### Tabs Permission
- **Purpose**: Detect which website you're on to apply the correct timezone
- **Scope**: Only reads the current tab's URL when you open the extension
- **Usage**: No browsing history tracking or monitoring

### Debugger Permission
- **Purpose**: Apply timezone changes to web pages
- **Scope**: Only activated when you set a timezone for a specific site
- **Function**: Temporarily overrides browser timezone for that tab only

### Host Permissions
- **Purpose**: Apply timezone overrides to websites you configure
- **Scope**: Only websites where you explicitly set timezone preferences

## Data Synchronization
Your settings sync across your Chrome browsers using Chrome's built-in sync system. This happens entirely within Google's ecosystem - we never see or handle this data.

## Data Security
- All data is stored locally in your Chrome browser
- Settings sync through Chrome's secure sync system
- No external transmission of personal data
- You can clear all data by removing the extension
